# Augmented Reality and Stable Diffusion
Combining augmented reality and stability diffusion through api calls.

## Installation
`clone [this repo]`

## Updates
v 0.0.1 boilerplate

## Setup
So this currently has a front-end, proxy-pass, and back-end

### Frontend
The current front end is simple webxr. Because of the limitations of io

### Proxy pass
Using a fastapi proxy pass for SSL and CORS headers. If backend has SSL and CORS enabled this is unnecessary. Automatic1111 supports both but I was having trouble with self-signed certificates. 

### Backend
So far automatic1111 [put link here] is the only backend. I'd like to look into invokeAI and other possible backends.

# Acknowledgements 
So many.
