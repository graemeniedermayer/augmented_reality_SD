# Augmented Reality and Stable Diffusion
Combining augmented reality and stability diffusion through api calls.

## Installation
`clone [this repo]`

## Updates
v 0.0.1 boilerplate

## Setup
So this currently has a front-end, proxy-pass, and back-end.

### Frontend
The current frontend is webxr. Because of the limitations of webxr and iOS I'd like to explore creating a iOS app in the future.

### Proxy pass
Using a fastapi proxy pass for SSL and CORS headers. If backend has SSL and CORS enabled this is unnecessary. Automatic1111 supports both but I was having trouble with self-signed certificates. I haven't looked into google Colab yet (it might not be necessary).

### Backend
So far automatic1111 [put link here] is the only backend. I'd like to look into invokeAI and other possible backends.

# Acknowledgements 
So many.
